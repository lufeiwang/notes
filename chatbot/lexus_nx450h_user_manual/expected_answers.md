Q: im an owner of a lexus 450H. i turned on s flow, and i have a passenger in the backseat, how come air conditioning is not coming out in the back?

bad A: """
The S-FLOW (Smart Flow) system in your Lexus NX 450h is designed to optimize energy usage by directing airflow only to occupied seats.

Why there's no A/C in the back:
If the S-FLOW system is turned on and the rear seats are unoccupied (or not detected as occupied), the system may automatically turn off the rear vents to conserve energy.

In your case:
Even though you have a passenger in the back seat, the A/C may still not blow air to the rear if:

The rear seat sensor didn't detect the passenger (e.g. light passenger or no seatbelt).

The system hasn't updated its zone detection yet.

The rear vents are closed manually.

Rear climate control (if available) is turned off or set incorrectly.

What you can do:
Turn off S-FLOW temporarily:

This disables the smart airflow optimization and sends air to all zones regardless of occupancy.

Check rear vent settings:

Ensure the rear vents are physically open (not shut manually).

If your model has rear climate controls, make sure theyâ€™re turned on and set to the right temp.

Have the rear passenger buckle their seatbelt:

This can help the system detect the seat as occupied.

Manually adjust airflow via climate settings:

Use the main infotainment screen to direct airflow to the rear seats.

Let me know if you want a step-by-step on how to disable S-FLOW or manually adjust rear airflow on your specific model year.

good A: """
âœ… Why A/C Isn't Reaching the Back Seat in Your Lexus 450h
From your manual:

When S-FLOW is ON, airflow is concentrated to the front seats only â€” regardless of whether there's someone in the back unless the car detects a rear passenger.

Passenger detection is based on the rear door opening/closing.

If the rear door wasn't opened and closed after the car started, the system may not recognize someone is in the back.

Even if you manually enable rear airflow, the system may revert to front-seat-only airflow if:

It believes no one is in the back.

Front-seat concentrated airflow is still active.

ðŸ”§ How to Fix It
Turn OFF S-FLOW via the climate settings screen.

This forces air to all seats, regardless of passenger detection.

Ensure the rear door was opened/closed after start.

If the rear passenger got in before startup, the system may not detect them.

Try restarting the vehicle after opening/closing the rear door.

Manually adjust airflow if needed.

If airflow is still not reaching the back, manually disable front-seat-only mode (i.e., disable S-FLOW).

This override should work regardless of detection logic.

TL;DR
The most likely cause is that S-FLOW is ON, and the system didnâ€™t detect a rear passenger because the rear door wasnâ€™t opened after the vehicle started. Turn S-FLOW off and make sure the door was opened/closed â€” that should restore rear A/C.

Let me know your model year if you'd like a walkthrough of the infotainment steps.
